# QuakeC Custom Progs

I am messing around with QuakeC to add a few features and fixes I wanted to my playthrough of Quake. The source is based on progs for Quake engine version 1.06.

I retrieved my source from the idgames ftp mirror on qaddicted.net:
https://www.quaddicted.com/files/idgames/idstuff/unsup/progs106.zip

The md5 hash of this file is as follows:

MD5 (progs106.zip) = 82c1ae8b5bc2879049c86fe825ec3f23

It matches hashes for the same files in the doomworld and gamers.org mirrors:
https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/idstuff/unsup/progs106
http://www.gamers.org/pub/idgames/idstuff/unsup/progs106.zip

This seems like a good place to start messing around.

I plan to implement a Sneep-Shockman torch, nail position correction by seven, and anything else that seems interesting.

Should be fun!
